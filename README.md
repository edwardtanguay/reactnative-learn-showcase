# reactnative-learn-showcase

This is a showcase site that I created while taking a [course on React Native](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react-native-v2). It's purpose is to get React Native's features working together as a semi-realistic, app that can be viewed on a smartphone and emulator. It is fully responsive, and has server-side functions that read/write to a MongoDB database with env variables. This would be a good starter site to create a Native React app.
